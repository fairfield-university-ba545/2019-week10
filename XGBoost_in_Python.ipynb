    "# Using XGBoost in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost is one of the most popular machine learning algorithm these days. Regardless of the type of prediction task at hand; regression or classification.\n",
    "XGBoost is well known to provide better solutions than other machine learning algorithms. In fact, since its inception, it has become the \"state-of-the-art” machine learning algorithm to deal with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll learn to build machine learning models using XGBoost in python. More specifically you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what Boosting is and how XGBoost operates.\n",
    "- how to apply XGBoost on a dataset and validate the results.\n",
    "- about various hyper-parameters that can be tuned in XGBoost to improve model's performance.\n",
    "- how to visualize the Boosted Trees and Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "But what makes XGBoost so popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Speed and performance__: Originally written in C++, it is comparatively faster than other ensemble classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Core algorithm is parallelizable__: Because the core XGBoost algorithm is parallelizable it can harness the power of multi-core computers. It is also parallelizable onto GPU’s and across networks of computers making it feasible to train on very large datasets as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Consistently outperforms other algorithm methods__: It has shown better performance on a variety of machine learning benchmark datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Wide variety of tuning parameters__: XGBoost internally has parameters for cross-validation, regularization, user-defined objective functions, missing values, tree parameters, scikit-learn compatible API etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) belongs to a family of boosting algorithms and uses the gradient boosting (GBM) framework at its core. It is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library. But wait, what is boosting? Well, Let's move on to it."

    "## Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is a sequential technique which works on the principle of an ensemble. It combines a set of weak learners and delivers improved prediction accuracy. At any instant `t`, the model outcomes are weighed based on the outcomes of previous instant `t-1`. The outcomes predicted correctly are given a lower weight and the ones miss-classified are weighted higher. Note that a weak learner is one which is slightly better than random guessing. For example, a decision tree whose predictions are slightly better than `50%` in a binary classification problem. Let's understand boosting in general with a simple illustration.\n",

    "\n",
    "Four classifiers (in 4 boxes), shown above, are trying to classify `+` and `-` classes as homogeneously as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Box 1: The first classifier (usually a decision stump) creates a vertical line (split) at `D1`. It says anything to the left of `D1` is + and anything to the right of `D1` is `-`. However, this classifier misclassifies three `+` points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note a Decision Stump is a Decision Tree model that only splits off at one level, therefore the final prediction is based on only one feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Box 2: The second classifier gives more weight to the three `+` misclassified points (see the bigger size of `+`) and creates a vertical line at `D2`. Again it says, anything to the right of D2 is `-` and left is `+`. Still, it makes mistakes by incorrectly classifying three `-` points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Box 3: Again, the third classifier gives more weight to the three `-` misclassified points and creates a horizontal line at `D3`. Still, this classifier fails to classify the points (in the circles) correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Box 4: This is a weighted combination of the weak classifiers (Box 1,2 and 3). As you can see, it does a good job at classifying all the points correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the basic idea behind boosting algorithms is building a **weak** model, making conclusions about the various feature importance and parameters, and then using those conclusions to build a new, **stronger** model and capitalize on the misclassification error of the previous model and try to reduce it. Now, let's come to XGBoost. To begin with, you should know about the default base learners of XGBoost: tree ensembles. The tree ensemble model is a set of classification and regression trees (CART). Trees are grown one after another ,and attempts to reduce the misclassification rate are made in subsequent iterations. [Here’s](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model.html) a simple example of a CART that classifies whether someone will like computer games straight from the XGBoost's documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you check the image in Tree Ensemble section, you will notice each tree gives a different prediction score depending on the data it sees and the scores of each individual tree are summed up to get the final score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will be using XGBoost to solve a regression problem. The dataset is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is also present in `sklearn`'s `datasets` module. It has `14` features describing various aspects of residential homes in Boston, the challenge is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes per $1000s."

    "\n",
    "At this point, before building the model, you should be aware of the tuning parameters that XGBoost provides. Well, there are a plethora of tuning parameters for tree-based learners in XGBoost and you can read all about them here. But the most common ones that you should know are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `learning_rate`: step size shrinkage used to prevent overfitting. Range is `[0,1]`\n",
    "- `max_depth`: determines how deeply each tree is allowed to grow during any boosting round.\n",
    "- `subsample`: percentage of samples used per tree. Low value can lead to underfitting.\n",
    "- `colsample_bytree`: percentage of features used per tree. High value can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: number of trees you want to build - the more trees you build, the longer the training will be.\n",
    "- `objective`: determines the loss function to be used like `reg:linear` for regression problems, `reg:logistic` for classification problems with only decision, `binary:logistic` for classification problems with probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost also supports regularization parameters to penalize models as they become more complex and reduce them to simple (parsimonious) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gamma`: controls whether a given node will split based on the expected reduction in loss after the split. A higher value leads to fewer splits. Supported only for tree-based learners.\n",
    "- `alpha`: L1 regularization on leaf weights. A large value leads to more regularization.\n",
    "- `lambda`: L2 regularization on leaf weights and is smoother than L1 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth mentioning that though you are using trees as your base learners, you can also use XGBoost's relatively less popular linear base learners and one other tree learner known as dart. All you have to do is set the `booster` parameter to either `gbtree` (default),`gblinear` or `dart`.\n",

    "You have reached the end of this tutorial. I hope this might have or will help you in some way or the other. You started off with understanding how Boosting works in general and then narrowed down to XGBoost specifically. You also practiced applying XGBoost on an open source dataset and along the way you learned about its hyper-parameters, doing cross-validation, visualizing the trees and in the end how it can also be used as a Feature Selection technique. Whoa!! that's something for starters, but there is so much to explore in XGBoost that it can't be covered in a single tutorial. "
